Miami-Dade County Building Import Tutorial
=============

**This import tutorial is inspired by and largely based on the work of the awesome people behind [LA County imports](https://github.com/osmlab/labuildings/blob/master/IMPORTING.md)**

### About this import

This import aims to put nearly 100,000 buildings on the map in Miami-Dade County from Miami-Dade County's open data repository.
We believe this will be a good asset for the community. Since the building count in OSM was very low prior to this import,
a huge number of them could have been imported automatically but obviously, a lot of buildings need to be reviewed by actual mappers. This is where your help is needed!


## Getting started

Before jumping into map editing, here are some info we'd like you to read.

### Creating an import account

First off, since data imports can be significantly different from what people would otherwise map, the common consensus requres you to create a dedicated import account,
so other people will instantly know that the data you insterted is from another source. Creating an import account also helps us monitor the progress.
The best is putting `_imports` (or `_miamibuildings`, etc.) after your existing OSM username (e.g. `jlevente_imports`).


### Getting familiar with OSM

If you are not familiar with OpenStreetMap and the JOSM editor, please check out these guides first and make sure you have a basic understanding of mapping.
To contribute to this project, you need to use the JOSM editor. Here are some resources to get you started:

- Download JOSM - https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Download
- LearnOSM - http://learnosm.org/en/josm/
- Mapbox Mapping wiki - https://www.mapbox.com/blog/making-the-most-josm/

## Manual import process

The tasks are organized on Tasking Manager (http://tasks.osm.jlevente.com). Check it out.
